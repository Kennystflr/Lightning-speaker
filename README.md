# Lightning-speaker
Project of Kenny Saint Fleur, Mathys Minsac, Lavallee Alexandre, Florian Bonnet--Galand and Victor Morel. 1st Year ENSEA students.
Design of the electronic board for a speaker.
Using a STM32 microcontroller, audio codec and a class D amplifier.

The purpose of this project is to design the electronic of a speaker. More specifically the goal is to 
take an entry signal from Jack 6.35 mm connector and to have the sound going out from a Loudspeaker. We
could also have a parametric eq using 2 encoders 1 for the gain and 1 for the frequency we would be changing.
We also want to have the system working on battery with Usb-C power delivery to charge up the whole system.

There is a schematic of the projects detailed review on this repository's root.

Basically we would be calcultating coeficients with
